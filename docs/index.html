    <h4>An EPICS driver for Emergent Vision Technologies (EVT) detectors</h4>

    <h4>Introduction:</h4>
    <p class="text-section-local">
        EVT provides high performance detectors notable for there high data transfer ability, with future plans for 25 gig ethernet on certain
        detector variants. EVT detectors are GenICam and GigEVision compliant, so should also function with a generic driver such as Aravis,
        but will most likely incur a performance penalty. The eSDK which is required to use this driver can be downloaded from the 
        <a href="https://emergentvisiontec.com/">EVT website</a>.

    <h4>Installation:</h4>
    <p class="text-section-local">
        Detailed installation instructions for the ADUVC driver can be seen in the <a href="https://github.com/jwlodek/ADEmergentVision/blob/master/README.md">README</a>
        file. To install ADEmergentVision, you must first install the eSDK and its dependancies. First, download the eSDK from the <a href="https://emergentvisiontec.com/">EVT website</a>.
        Then, run the included install script, and find where the eSDK was installed. On linux, it is placed in the /opt/EVT/eSDK directory. Next, enter the evtSupport directory, edit
        the appropriate pre_eSDK script for your OS. as explained in the installation guide found there, and run the script. Finally, make sure that the lib versions copied to
        os/YOUR_ARCH match the ones loaded for compilation in the Makefile in evtSupport. Finally, enter the top level of ADEmergentVision and run make -sj.
    </p>

    <h4>Driver Contents:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>prep_eSDK_Linux.sh-> bash script that copies eSDK includes and libs to correct locations for compilation on linux systems
        <li>ADEmergentVision driver        ->  The source code for the area detector driver itself in the evtApp/src directory.</li>
        <li>iocEVT            ->  Example ioc for use with the ADEmergentVision driver. Shows how to connect to a detector in the EPICS IOC shell</li>
    </ul>
    <hr />
    <h4>Usage:</h4>
    <p class="text-section-local">
        Once the driver is installed, you may start the ioc by entering the IOC folder and running './startEPICS.sh'.
        You may then integrate ADEmergentVision into your area detector screen setup.
        Below is an image of the ADEmergentVision base control screen. It extends the standard ADBase screen with EVT controls for various camera functionality.
